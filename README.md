### A Beautiful theme for vim with dark blue and ice colors distributed in a harmonic way.

---
* Warning: DarkBlue Ice for neovim(lua) is using some colors of [Nord](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord), since DarkBlue Ice doesn't yet have any pallet with colors like green, yellow etc.
## How to install
* Download the `darkblueice.vim` file on [github releases](https://github.com/Dedsd/DarkBlue-Ice-for-vim/releases)
* Move `darkblueice.vim` to `~/.vim/colors`
* Make sure your `vimrc` or `.vim` file looks like this:
```
colorscheme darkblueice
set termguicolors
```
